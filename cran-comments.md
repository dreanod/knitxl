## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I addressed the following issue:

> Please use only undirected quotation marks in the description text.
> e.g. `knit()` --> 'knit()'
> In your case there are no quotes needed. Function names are sufficiently
> marked by putting brackets afterwards. So please omit all quotes around
> function names.

The description field was updated as instructed.
